** Initial steps (to be executed once) **
1) Edit setenv.bat to point to the correct locations on your local machine
2) Run collect_dependencies.bat


Once initial steps are complete, use open_solution.bat to open the project solution
- NOTE: this .bat file simply calls setenv.bat first to avoid having to add everything to your system path
